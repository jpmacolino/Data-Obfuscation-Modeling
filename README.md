# Data-Obfuscation-Modeling
Here I worked on data from Sure Tomorrow insurance company for Project 10 of Practicum by Yandex. They want to protect their clients' data, so I was tasked to develop a data transforming algorithm that would make it hard to recover personal information from the transformed data. Part of this project was academic, providing a theoretical proof of the obfuscation technique. From there, I demonstrated that the algorithm works correctly. Additionally, it was important to maintain quality of a machine learning model despite the obfuscation, which was also accomplished.
